# Hi, I'm Muntasir Basher
Welcome to my ICS3U0R portfolio. I’ll use this site to post my work and reflections.

## About me
Hi, Im a 16 year old kid (soon to be adult) and this is one of my first ever projects! I'm a very big sports fan such as F1 (Mercedes being my favourite team), football and cricket. My favourite color is Tiffany Blue (a really cool blend of blue and green) and my favourite dish is fried rice. I hope to learn a lot about coding through my grade 11 year and carry it into my future as well! :D


## Culminating Project
- 🧪 Chemical Warfare 🧪

- 📌 Description: Chemical Warfare is a two-player local competitive “paint the map" territory game where you’re tasked to color more of the map compared to your opponent with your respective color. There will be special power-ups (e.g. speed-boost, increased size) which would aid you in order to complete the final object which is to color in the most at the end of the time limit.
