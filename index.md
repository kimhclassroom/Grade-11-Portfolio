## About me
Hi, Im a 16 year old kid (soon to be adult) and this is one of my first ever projects! I'm a very big sports fan such as F1 (Mercedes being my favourite team) football and cricket. My favourite color is a Tiffany Blue (a really cool blend of blue and green) and my favourite dish is fried rice. I hope to learn a lot about coding through my grade 11 year and carry it into my future as well!
