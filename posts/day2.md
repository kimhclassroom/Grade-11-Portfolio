# Day 2: 
## Tuesday, January 13, 2026

Today I had combined both the codes that me and Jojy had made the previous day. I did this because in the long run, it will be much easier to have all the code working in harmony well before making 20 different codes and then having trouble having them work well together due to different variable names or just the overall format. Some issues that I had faced when doing this would be of course some very minimal variable name differences but the main problem would have been when the CharacterSelect screen goes to the MainScreen. Jojy had made it so when the spacebar was pressed, the screen would automatically shift to the main screen which makes sense logically but when we had mixed it together, the code skipped the character selection and went straight to the main game. To fix this, I had edited one of his keyPressed If statements where unless both players had a color assigned to them, the screen would be locked on the character screen. I had also implemented the slime sprites into the game and depending on the color chosen, they specific colored slime will be present onto the game. This will make it easier in the future to differentiate the players as well as it is much more convenient and efficient since it will require less power and time from the computer to load in the images. If I had made it so it always imported all the slimes, it may cause some input delay and lag in the future (may be minimal but might slowly add up over time).
