# Day 3: 
## Wednesday, January 14, 2026

Today I continued to work on the slime sprites I had added yesterday. I specifically created the movement for the players where player 1 could utilize the WASD keys while player 2 would use the arrow keys. I had thought this was very easy to implement but the main problem that I had faced when adding this would have been that the movement was very “clunky/choppy”. The keys felt like it was delayed and was a very unpleasant experience. To fix this, I had figured out that I should replace every movement with a boolean expression where if the button is pressed, the boolean would be true and the player could move in that specific direction and as soon as they released the key, it would turn false and stop instantly. This had worked very well and I had learned this from my last “Dodge the Obstacle” project.
